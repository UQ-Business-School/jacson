Groups that present on the same day will lead the Q and A session.  </p>\n<p>The Four Frames topics will be identified in weeks 1 and 2 of the course and time will be given during the course to work on these topics. Topics should be selected that are: (1) topical; (2) reflect some of the criteria of a “wicked problem”; (3) it will be possible to find quality academic research articles or industry (grey) reports about the issue and (4) the topic opens itself to the application of all of the four frames. All groups will need to have sign off from the lecturer by the end of Week 3 lecture that their topic is approved.</p>\n<p>Special attention by each member of the group should be given to the incorporation of the academic literature (will be 80% or more of the Reference List) to support key points being made under each frame; smooth transitions between speakers and the frames are expected; and presenting in the time frame allocated of 15 minutes plus 3-5 minutes of questions. See the marking rubric for more guidance.</p>\n<p>There will be a maximum of 12 PowerPoint slides used in the presentation (plus not part of the 12 slides maximum, 2 extra slides, one introductory slide that gives the topic name and team members’ names; and 2-3 slides of all of the references used in preparing the presentation, and the completed AI proforma as the final slide.</p>\n<p>Each of the 6 team members will present as the assessment mark will be based on the quality of the slides, and<strong> </strong>each individual's contribution to the presentation and the Q and A section. Prior examples of successful presentations are provided in Week 1 and on the Blackboard site.</p>\n<p>Peer Review: Group members are expected to contribute equally, fulfilling the tasks agreed on. If there are disagreements in relation to team members' contributions that cannot be resolved, students must bring the problem to the attention of the lecturer as early as possible. Students will undertake then a Peer Review process, which can influence the marks of those who do not contribute to group work.</p>\n<p>Please Note: The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

The assignment will also further develop your written communication and analytical skills.</p>\n<p><strong>The Task:</strong> Use the four (three frames is also permissible, but not less) organisational frames and related concepts and literature to identify, analyse and offer a solution to an organisational/community/societal issue. It is recommended that you choose an issue or problem which is complete (even if it was never successfully resolved), and which you see there is scope for learning by reflection. <strong>Note: </strong>you are free to choose the issue.</p>\n<p>You should structure the report as follows :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.0 Brief overview - Briefly describe the issue and the organisational or community context clearly, including its degree of “wickedness’.</li>\n<li>2.0 Critical analysis - Critically analyse and evaluate the issue from the perspective of each of the four (or three) organisational frames: use the four subheadings of 2.1 Structural, 2.2 Human resource, 2.3 Political and 2.4 Cultural. In so doing, identify which frame(s) were dominant. Support your analysis and demonstrate your insight into your issue by integrating relevant academic literature, ideally peer reviewed quality journal articles. This is a critical criterion. Consider how you can support your claims and key points by using this quality academic research.</li>\n<li>3.0 Recommendations - Draw on your knowledge of the frames used to make specific recommendations for how the issue or problem could have been more effectively addressed or resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Format for the report: Abstracts/executive summaries are not required and should not be included.</li>\n<li>Use a standard referencing system, to provide a totally accurate and complete list of all references used in compiling the report. The reference list is not included in the word count.</li>\n<li>Assignments exceeding the word limit by more than 10% will be penalised in line with UQ policy. </li>\n<li>You can assume complete confidentiality: The report is for educational purposes only and will be treated as confidential. </li>\n<li>Marking will follow the rubric provided on the course Blackboard site. Look again at the rubric as you prepare the report.</li>\n<li>A word count must be provided on the cover page with your name and student number.</li>\n<li>Appendix A (AI statement) attached to the submission</li>\n<li>A random check will be made of the Reference List to determine its validity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.

Your tasks will include, for example (1) initially describing the nature of this change around its degree of key drivers, complexity, timing and consequences; (2) how this change should be managed and lead either across a number of key stages or in terms of addressing a number of major issues that are typically identified in the academic literature and in numerous change management models or frameworks, as essential for successful change; and (3) finally as a consultant you will provide a list of recommendations that follow on from this detailed critical analysis based on this critical analysis applying academic literature and analysis.</p>\n<p>Your sources of data that will guide your analysis of the change, and the list of recommendations, must include the major use of the large body of academic research addressed in the course seminars, and other published materials in reputable academic journals as articles, as book chapters, quality books and possibly reputable web pages (e.g., of management consulting companies).</p>\n<p>In sum, in preparation for this Change Management Case Study Examination, you will need to be able to use and apply in a critical manner the key ideas and findings addressed in the course seminars, and from scholarly articles from quality sources, to provide: 1) an analysis of the key issues that might be in play according to studies of best practice in the change process (including change drivers, why these issues exist, what can be done to resolve them); 2) using your knowledge of the change management literature, potential options available to the leaders and managers, and their likely effectiveness, in your analysis of the case study; and 3) following on from 1 and 2, to provide a number (3 or more) of recommendations about how this change might be effectively planned and executed.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>This assessment task is to be completed in-person.
