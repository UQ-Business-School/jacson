A series of review questions will be available on Blackboard and should be completed on submission of your teams manual. The evaluation process assists the teaching team to understand how each student contributed and the findings are confidential. The peer evaluation can affect each student's mark for this assignment. Further details will be provided in class and on Blackboard. This assessment builds student employability by providing an opportunity to access knowledge, think critically, problem solve and work in a team.</p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement:</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
