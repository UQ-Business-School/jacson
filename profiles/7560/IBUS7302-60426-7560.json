To reassure students, the Assignment Groups are created to have as equal numbers of students as possible. However, once we proceed past Week 4, it is unfair to ask group members to change groups thus some groups may have unequal numbers. Please see the assignment guide and check Blackboard for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>◆ Each group member must submit their individual contributions to the team assignment on Blackboard to ensure proper documentation of participation.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although the submission will not be marked, not submitting the individual contribution materials will exclude you from receiving the group’s debate mark, since it implies you did not contribute to the group assignment. Make sure you document your contribution. If your group uses online files, use track changes to show your contribution, and save the files as evidence.</li>\n<li>A reference list of all materials used should also be included; minimum of three peer-reviewed reference per team member. </li>\n<li>Late submission penalty applies for Individual Contribution and Group Outline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>◆ Academic Integrity policy is in effect</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is the responsibility of each individual and group to adhere to Academic Integrity. Plagiarism (high similarity matches) including translation APPs will result in zero marks for the assignment! </li>\n<li>All parts of this course assessments evaluate students' abilities, skills, and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Students are advised that the use of AI technologies <em>to assist writing is prohibited </em>and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. This includes dictionary and translation applications. In short, <em>anything that involve copying and pasting and/or uploading into another application, and then copying it and/or downloading it is prohibited</em> – this will be detected. However, like the classic tool, Google, it can be used to suggest ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>◆ In-class compulsory (formative) Audience Marking of all the presentations are mandatory; each student must submit the Audience Marking sheet at the end of class to validate their own individual mark for this assignment.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>◆ Group Peer (members) evaluations are mandatory and must be submitted within five calendar days of the assessment due date.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to submit a review may result in a decrease in marks. All students in the group will receive the same mark and each member will have the opportunity to evaluate the contributions of their peers using four criteria. If a student is absent from the scheduled presentation without a valid excuse, they will receive no marks for the assignment.</li>\n<li>Important Mark Moderation Based on Peer Review – highest score is 9, see explanation below.</li>\n<li><strong>The moderation of individual marks will be based on the following overall average review:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>8.5 to 9.0 (consistently demonstrated full contribution to group), no deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>8.0 to 8.4</strong> (demonstrated medium-high level contribution) <strong>5% deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>6.0 to 7.99</strong> (demonstrated medium level contribution), <strong>15% deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>3.0 to 5.99</strong> (demonstrated medium-low contribution), <strong>25% deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1.01 to 2.99</strong> (demonstrated low contribution in several criteria or submitted contribution passed agreed group deadline), <strong>50% deduction from group mark</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>1, no individual mark will be awarded.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>◆ Criteria and Marking:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Groups will be awarded a group score, and all members will share this same score which may be moderated by Peer Assessment results.
