Individual in-tutorial quizzes worth 15% of your final mark are linked to the tutorial presentations.</p>\n<p>All aspects of this assignment relate to employability-building skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Groups will randomly be created by the course coordinator/facilitator. <em>Once the teams are created, you must contact your group by the end of week 3 or risk receiving a poor peer review that impacts your marks.</em> You are not allowed to change groups yourself; the group change deadline is week 3. All are in the same situation, so please take note of your presentation time and adjust your schedule accordingly.</strong></p>\n<p>Students must submit all assessments to pass the course.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer Evaluation: </strong>The purpose of this evaluation is to assess a member’s contribution to the group effort. Group members may contribute to the group along various dimensions. These include their organisation/project management, knowledge/research, communication, and responsibility, including supporting the group and members in any way. Use the 9-point rating scale given below to rate yourself and members of your group. Please be as objective as possible, taking behaviours rather than personal style into consideration. <strong>Peer reviews are compulsory to ensure that a contribution score is available for all moderation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> You are required to assess your peers on their contribution to the group assignment by allocating each group member a mark in each of the four criteria. For each criterion, allocate a mark between one and six, where a mark of one (1) indicates no contribution or submitting a contribution past the agreed group deadline, and a mark of nine (9) indicates that they made the maximum contribution possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 = Person demonstrated <strong>no contribution in this criterion</strong> or submitted contributions past the agreed-upon group deadline.</li>\n<li>1.01 – 1.99 = Person demonstrated a low contribution to the group in this criterion.</li>\n<li>2 – 3.99 = Person demonstrated a medium-low contribution to the group in this criterion.</li>\n<li>4 – 5.99 = Person demonstrated a medium-level contribution to the group in this criterion.</li>\n<li>6 – 8.4 = Person consistently demonstrated a medium-high level of contribution to the group in this criterion.</li>\n<li>8.5 - 9 = Person consistently demonstrated a high-level contribution to the group in a criterion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A mark of six (6) or less (1 to 6), based on the above guide (out of 9) for any criteria, requires a comment; otherwise, it is invalid.</p>\n<p>To take account of the possibility that a student does not contribute to one or all criteria, 1 signifies that a student has not contributed.</p>\n<p>Peer reviews are compulsory and must be submitted within five days of the assessment due date; <em>not submitting peer reviews may decrease marks. </em>If no peer review is received from a student after 5 days, then no contribution scores are calculated and are not available for all moderation. No exceptions!</p>\n<p><strong>Important Mark Moderation Based on Peer Review – highest score is 9, see explanation below.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The moderation of individual marks will be based on the following overall average review:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>8.5 to 9.0 </strong>(consistently demonstrated full contribution to group),<strong> no deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>8.0 to 8.4 </strong>(demonstrated medium-high level contribution) <strong>5% deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>6.0 to 7.99 </strong>(demonstrated medium level contribution),<strong> 15% deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>3.0 to 5.99</strong> (demonstrated medium-low contribution), <strong>25% deduction from group mark.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1.01 to 2.99</strong> (demonstrated low contribution in several criteria or submitted contribution passed agreed group deadline), <strong>50% deduction from group mark</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>1 no individual mark will be awarded.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria 1: Organisation/Project Management</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Role in contributing to the process needed to complete the assignment.</strong> Consider their approach to setting up meeting times and work submission deadlines as well as their willingness to listen to other group members' opinions. </p>\n<p><strong>Criteria 2: Knowledge/research</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Contribution of research, knowledge, opinions, and skills</strong> to group discussions and work completion. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintaining academic integrity (ensuring original work; no plagiarised and/or AI-generated materials).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria 3: Communication</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How well one collaborated and communicated</strong> with others in the group and fulfilled their roles within the group. To determine your mark, consider if each group member:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was present at all meetings, as long as feasibly possible (either in person or via phone/online) (barring legitimate reasons),</li>\n<li>played an active role in facilitating agreement and resolving conflict and,</li>\n<li>provided timely responses to all communications and queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Criteria 4: Responsibility</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Taking responsibility for the group’s outcome</strong>, and consistently acting in a manner that demonstrated they were keen for the group to perform well (e.g., supporting the group). </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This includes ensuring that the English language is used in all forms of communication. Since the official language of Australia is English, non-compliance can lead to assessments awarded the mark of zero, and non-compliance in group settings be interpreted as exclusionary behaviour, a form of bullying and a serious offence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Students must follow the criteria found in the assignment guide provided on Blackboard or risk failing the assignment.</strong></p>\n<p>The week of the Oral Presentation will be assigned to each group early in Semester. Group Oral Presentation Slides due 1 week prior to presentation.</p>\n<p>Not submitting the individual contribution materials implies you made no contribution(s) to the group assignment.</p>\n<p>A hardcopy, handout of the presentation with reference list are to be handed to the marker(s) on the day of the presentation; all groups must be ready to present on the day of presentation with their presentation materials on a USB or alternative device to use the seminar room facilities. <strong>Please Note: </strong>The presentation will be recorded for marking purposes per UQ policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Peer reviews are compulsory and must be submitted within 5 calendar days of the assessment due date, <em>not submitting peer reviews may decrease marks. </em>If no peer review is received from a student after 5 calendar days, then is not included for all moderation. No exceptions!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AI Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Translation (MT) are emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task.
