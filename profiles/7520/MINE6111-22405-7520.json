Opportunities for CI may come from discussions with truck/shovel operators, dispatchers and/or maintainers, or analysis of time usage and production data. If you are not in an operational setting, time usage data from a real case study will be made available to you. You are required to submit a two-page project brief outlining the scope of your intended CI project. In particular, this will estimate the value and ease of capture of the improvement idea. The project brief should cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description of opportunity:</strong> What is the performance gap that you have identified for improvement? Provide a brief description of the evidence available (e.g. benchmark data) to support this gap.</li>\n<li><strong>Value proposition:</strong> What is the potential to close the performance gap (e.g. completely solve, partially solve) and what benefits (financial, safety, sustainability) will this bring across the fleet?</li>\n<li><strong>Project evidence and methodology: </strong>What data do you require to support evidence of the performance gap? How you intend to collect and process this data? What potential solutions exist to close the performance gap? What is your estimate of the technical and implementation risks associated with this range of solutions?</li>\n<li><strong>Ease of capture:</strong> Provide a brief evaluation of the technical and project feasibility of your preferred solution. What risks are involved in implementing the change and how can these be managed?</li>\n<li><strong>Project Plan:</strong> Prepare a Gantt chart for the implementation of your CI project. Include project review and sign-off points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please refer to Blackboard for a detailed marking criteria.</p>\n<p>This assessment task evaluates students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Translation (MT).
